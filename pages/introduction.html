            When you listen to your most favourite song, most probably you would have wanted to play it by yourself. But what if you donâ€™t have a proper background in music? Then obviously you would want to learn it. There are thousands of ways of learning music, experience it and create music, such as conventional classrooms, which most of the time have lots of theories to be learnt before getting into real action. But what if there's a software solution to learn music from anywhere with some drag and drops and clicks even without any technical background ?

            Music Blocks is a free and open-source, browser-based software, designed basically for students to learn music in fun and interactive way. It is composed of basic building blocks of music such as rhythm, pitch, intervals, and tone which are used to create music. There are some other utilities introduced to combine these building blocks in order to make more complex and creative music. This platform can be used to teach students about the fundamentals of music, how these fundamental elements can be combined together to create music and explore effects of music by changing parameters of each music blocks.
