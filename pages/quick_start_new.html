                Interested in getting started right away? This quick start guide will walk through how to create simple
                melodies in Music Blocks. A melody is comprised of a series of notes. Notes are pitches with specified
                rhythmic values, and these notes are strung together in patterns to create melody. Melodies can be
                familiar or unpredictable, simple or complex—the choice is yours. 
                <h3><small>For this guide, we will start with the simple melody <b>“Hot Cross Buns”</b>.</small></h3>

            <br/>
            <p class="text-justify">
                “Hello World” is the most basic code that a programmer learns to write. Following is a sample code
                written using a programming language:
                <br/>
                <span><mark>print "Hello world!"</mark></span>
                <br/>
                <br>
                Output of this program will be printing the text:
                <mark><i>Hello world!</i></mark>
                .
                <br/><br/>
                In this case, the “performer” is the computer. The user has told the computer to “perform” the task of
                printing the letters “Hello World” on the screen. The “cue” for the performance is the moment when the
                user presses the Return/Enter key, to tell the computer to perform the given script.
                <br/><br/>
                Music Blocks works in such the same manner, but with notes and rhythms. Let's start by making one of the
                most basic melodies we can, comprised of only three notes—the first three notes of “Hot Cross Buns”!

                Now that you have made a simple melody with Music Blocks, you might try the following creative

            <ul class="text-justify">
                <li>
                    Changing the order of the <a href="#section4actionblock_desc">action</a> blocks

                <li>
                    Changing the placement of the <a href="#section4repeatblock_desc">repeat</a> blocks and how many times they repeat

                    Changing the <a href="#section4_pitchblock_desc">pitches</a>

            Each time you change something press RUN and listen to the results. What does it sound like? Do you like it?
            How would you describe the resulting sound? You will probably find versions that you like and versions that
            sound just plain silly—just try it out the possibilities!
