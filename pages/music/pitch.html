                <td>The Pitch block is used to specify the pitch of a note. By default, we use traditional western Solfege, i.e., Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. You can also specify pitch by using a note name, e.g., F#. An octave specification is also required (as an argument for our pitch block) and changes integers for every cycle of C (i.e. C4 is higher than B3). When used with the Pitch-time Matrix block, a row is created for each Pitch block.</td>
