        <p align="justify">Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds as they move through time. You can take any of the sounds listed above and arrange them rhythmically to create music. The term rhythm is also used to describe a specific pattern of sounds. In a very simple form, music can be created by clapping your hands to a specific rhythm. There are many aspects of rhythm and several terms related to it that help us to better understand music.</p>

                The Note block clamp is used to define individual notes by specifying a note value, e.g., whole note (1), half note (2), quarter note (4), etc. and a collection of pitch blocks to define individual tones or chords.

                The Dot clamp is used to dot any contained notes. A dotted note plays for 150% the length of the original note, e.g., a dotted quarter note is equivalent to a 3/8 note. Double-dotting is not yet supported. (When used with the Tuplet block, the duration of the tuplet is extended by 50%.)
