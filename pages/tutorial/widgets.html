        The Status widget is a tool for inspecting the status of Music Blocks as it is running. By default, the key, BPM, and volume are displayed. Also, each note is displayed as it is played. There is one row per voice in the status table.
        <br>
        Additional Print blocks can be added to the Status widget to display additional music factors, e.g., duplicate, transposition, skip, staccato, slur, and graphics factors, e.g., x, y, heading, color, shade, grey, and pensize.

        Music Blocks provides a widget, the Pitch-time Matrix, as a scaffold for getting started.
        <br>
        Once you've launched Music Blocks in your browser, start by clicking on the Pitch-time Matrix stack that appears in the middle of the screen. (For the moment, ignore the Start block.) You'll see a grid organized vertically by pitch and horizontally by rhythm.

        The matrix in the figure above has three Pitch blocks and one Rhythm block, which is used to create a 3 x 3 grid of pitch and time.
        <br>
        Note that the default matrix has five Pitch blocks, hence, you will see five rows, one for each pitch. (A sixth row at the bottom is used for specifying the rhythms associated with each note.) Also by default, there are two Rhythm blocks, which specifies six quarter notes followed by one half note. Since the Rhythm blocks are inside of a Repeat block, there are fourteen (2 x 7) columns for selecting notes.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <div class="row">

        <p class="text-justify">
            By clicking on individual cells in the grid, you should hear individual notes (or chords if you click on more than one cell in a column). In the figure, three quarter notes are selected (black cells). First <mark>Re 4</mark>, followed by <mark>Mi 4</mark>, followed by <mark>Sol 4</mark>.

           Once you have a group of notes (a "chunk") that you like, click on the Save button (just to the right of the Play button). This will create a stack of blocks that can used to play these same notes programmatically. (More on that below.)
           <br>
            You can rearrange the selected notes in the grid and save other chunks as well.

        </div>

        There is also an Erase button that will clear the grid.
        <br/>
        Don't worry. You can reopen the matrix at anytime (it will remember its previous state) and since you can define as many chunks as you want, feel free to experiment.
        <br/>
        Tip: You can put a chunk inside a Pitch-time Matrix block to generate the matrix to corresponds to that chunk.

        <p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-justify">The chunk created when you click on the matrix is a stack of blocks. The blocks are nested: an Action block contains three Note value blocks, each of which contains a Pitch block. The Action block has a name automatically generated by the matrix, in this case, chunk. (You can rename the action by clicking on the name.). Each note has a duration (in this case 4, which represents a quarter note).
        Try putting different numbers in and see (hear) what happens. Each note block also has a pitch block (if it were a chord, there would be multiple Pitch blocks nested inside the Note block's clamp). Each pitch block has a pitch name (Re, Mi, and Sol), and a pitch octave; in this example, the octave is 4 for each pitch. (Try changing the pitch names and the pitch octaves.)</p>
        <br/>
        To play the chuck, simply click on the action block (on the word action). You should hear the notes play, ordered from top to bottom.

        Tuplets are a collection of notes that get scaled to a specific duration. Using tuplets makes it easy to create groups of notes that are not based on a power of 2.</p>
        In the example above, three quarter notes—defined in the Simple Tuplet block—are played in the time of a single quarter note. The result is three twelfth notes. (This form, which is quite common in music, is called a triplet. Other common tuplets include a quintuplet and a septuplet.)

        <h2>4. Musical Modes</h2></p>
        <p class="text-justify">
        Musical modes are used to specify the relationship between intervals (or steps) in a scale. Since Western music is based on 12 half-steps per octave, modes speficy how many half steps there are between each note in a scale.
        By default, Music Blocks uses the Major mode, which, in the Key of C, maps to the white keys on a piano. The intervals in the Major mode are <mark>2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1</mark>. Many other common modes are built into Music Blocks, including, of course, Minor mode, which uses <mark>2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2</mark> as its intervals.
        Note that not every mode uses 7 intervals per octave. For example, the Chromatic mode uses 11 intervals: <mark>1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1</mark>. The Japanese mode uses only 5 intervals: <mark>1, 4, 2, 3, 2]</mark>,. What is important is that the sum of the intervals in an octave is 12 half-steps.

        In the above example, the widget has been launched with Major mode (the default). Note that the notes included in the mode are indicated by the black boxes, which are arrayed in a circular pattern of tweleve half-steps to complete the octave.
        <br/>
        Since the intervals in the Major mode are 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, the notes are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9,11, and 12 (one octave above 0).
        <br/>
        The widget controls run along the toolbar at the top. From left to right are:
        <br/>
        Play all, which will play a scale using the current mode;
        <br/>
        Save, which will save the current mode as the Custom mode and save a stack of Pitch blocks that can be used with the Pitch-time Matrix block;
        <br/>
        Rotate counter-clockwise, which will rotate the mode counter-clockwise (See the example below);
        <br/>
        Rotate clockwise, which will rotate the mode clockwise (See the example below);
        <br/>
        Invert, which will invert the mode (See the example below);
        <br/>
        Undo, which will restore the mode to the previous version; and
        <br/>
        Close, which will close the widget.
        <br/>
        You can also click on individual notes to activate or deactivate them.
        <br/>
        Note that the mode inside the Custom mode block is updated whenever the mode is changed inside the widget.
