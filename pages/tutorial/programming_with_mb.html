            Every time you create a new Action stack, Music Blocks creates a new block specific to, and linked with, that stack. (The new block is found at the top of the Block palette, found on the left edge of the screen.) Clicking on and running this block is the same as clicking on your stack. By default, the new blocks are named <mark>chunk</mark>,<mark> chunk1</mark>, <mark>chunk2</mark>... but you can rename them by editing the labels on the Action blocks.
            <br>
            An Action block contains a sequence of actions that will only be executed when the block is referred to by something else, such as a start block. This is useful in orchestrating more complex programs of music.
            <br>
            A Start Block is a chunk that will automatically be executed once the start button is pressed. This is where most of your programs will begin at. There are many ways to Run a program: you can click on the Run button at the upper-left corner of the screen (the "rabbit") to run the music at a fast speed; click on the Run Slow button (the "turtle") to run it slower; and the Step button (the "snail"), to step through the program one block per button press.
            <br>
            In the example above, the Chunk block is inside of a Start block, which means that when any of the start buttons is pressed, the code inside the Start block (the Chunk block) will be executed. You can add more chunks after this one inside the Start block to execute them sequentially.

        <p>The Step Pitch block will move up or down notes in a scale from the last played note. In the example above, Step Pitch blocks are used inside of Repeat blocks to repeat the code 7 times, playing up and down a scale.

        <p>Another way to move up and down notes in a scale is to use the Consonant Step Up and Consonant Step Down blocks. These blocks calculate the number of half-steps to the next note in the current mode. (You can read more about Musical Modes below.)

        <p>The Sharp and Flat blocks can be wrapped around Pitch blocks, Note value blocks, or <a href="#chunks">chunks</a>. A sharp will raise the pitch by one half step.

        <p>The Adjust-transposition block can be used to make larger shifts in pitch in half step units. A positive number shifts the pitch up and a negative number shifts the pitch down. The input must be a whole number. To shift an entire octave, transpose by 12 half-steps up. -12 will shift an octave down.</p>

        <p>You can "dot" notes using the Dot block. A dotted note extends the rhythmic duration of a note by 50%. E.g., a dotted quarter note will play for 3/8 (1/4 + 1/8) of a beat. A dotted eighth note will play for 3/16 (1/8 + 1/16) of a beat.
        <br>
        You can also simply change the note value to mimic a dotted note, for example indicating 3/8 instead of 1/4, for a dotted quarter note. </p>

        <p>The Swing block works on pairs of notes (specified by note value), adding some duration (specified by swing value) to the first note and taking the same amount from the second note. Notes that do not match note value are unchanged.
        <br>
        In the example, <mark>re5</mark> would be played as a <mark>1/6</mark> note and <mark>mi5</mark> would be played as a <mark>1/12</mark> note (<mark>1/8 + 1/24 === 1/6</mark> and <mark>1/8 - 1/24 === 1/12</mark>). Observe that the total duration of the pair of notes is unchanged.

        The Set volume block will change the volume of the notes. The default is 50; the range is 0 (silence) to 100 (full volume).
        <br>
        The Crescendo block will increase (or decrease) the volume of the contained notes by a specified amount for every note played. For example, if you have 3 notes in sequence contained in a Crescendo block with a value of 5, the final note will be at 15% more than the original value for volume.
        <br>
        The Staccato block shortens the length of the actual note—making them tighter bursts—while maintaining the specified rhythmic value of the notes.
        <br>
        The Slur block lengthens the sustain of notes—running longer than the noted duration and blending it into the next note—while maintaining the specified rhythmic value of the notes.

        The Set Relative Volume block modifies the clamped note's volume according to the input value of the block in an added (or subtracted when negative) percentage with respect to the original volume.For example,100 would mean doubling the current volume.

        In the augmented fifth example above, a chord of D5 and A5 are played, followed by a chord of E5 and C5. In the minor third example, which includes a shift of one octave, first a chord of D5 and F5 is played, followed by chord of E5 and G6.</p>

        The Vibrato Block adds a rapid variation in pitch to any contained notes. The intensity of the variation ranges from 1 to 100 (cents), e.g. plus or minus up to one half step. The rate argument determines the rate of the variation.

        <p>There are many ways to interactive with Music Blocks, including tracking the mouse position to impact some aspect of the music.</p>

        For example, we can launch the phrases (chunks) interactively. When the mouse is in the lower-left quadrant, <mark>chunk</mark> is played; lower-right quadrant, <mark>chunk1</mark>; upper-left quadrant, <mark>chunk2</mark>; and upper-right quadrant, <mark>chunk3</mark>.

        In the example above, a simple two-key piano is created by associating click events on two different turtles with individual notes. Can you make an 8-key piano?.

        You can also add a bit of randomness to your music. In the top example above, the One-of block is used to randomly assign either <mark>Do</mark> or <mark>Re</mark> each time the Note value block is played. In the bottom example above, the One-of block is used to randomly select between <mark>chunk1</mark> and <mark>chunk2</mark>.
