        <h2>1. Note Value Blocks</h2></p>
        <p>At the heart of Music Blocks is the Note value block. The Note value block is a container for a Pitch block that specifies the duration (note value) of the pitch.</p>

        <p>At the top of the example above, a single (detached) Note value block is shown. The <mark>1/8</mark> is value of the note, which is, in this case, an eighth note. At the bottom, two notes that are played consecutively are shown. They are both <mark>1/8</mark> notes, making the duration of the entire sequence <mark>1/4</mark>.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In this example, different note values are shown. From top to bottom, they are: <mark>1/4</mark> for an quarter note, <mark>1/16</mark> for a sixteenth note, and <mark>1/2</mark> for a half note. Note that any mathematical operations can be used as input to the Note value.</p>

        <h2>2. Pitch Blocks</h2></p>
        <p>As we have seen, Pitch blocks are used inside the <a href="#notevalue_section">Note value</a> blocks. The Pitch block specifies the pitch name and pitch octave of a note that in combination determines the frequency (and therefore pitch) at which the note is played.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
                <img src="./dist/img/tutorials/sound/pitch_1.png">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>There are many systems you can use to specify a pitch block's name and octave. Some examples are shown above. The top Pitch block is specified using a Solfege block (Sol in Octave 6), which contains the notes Do Re Me Fa Sol La Ti. The middle block is specified using a Pitch-name block (B flat in Octave 4), which contains the notes C D E F G A B. The last block is specified using the Hertz block in conjunction with a Number block (440 Hertz) , which corresponds to the frequency of the sound made.
        <br>
        The octave is specified using a number block and is restricted to whole numbers. In the case where the pitch name is specified by frequency, the octave is ignored.
        <br>
        Note that the pitch name can also be specified using a Text block.
        <br>
        Please refer to the below charts for a visual representation of where notes are located on a keyboard or staff.</p>

            <p>Anywhere a Pitch block can be used—e.g., inside of the matrix or a Note value block—a Drum Sample block can also be used instead. Currently there about two dozen different samples from which to choose. The default drum is a kick drum.</p>
