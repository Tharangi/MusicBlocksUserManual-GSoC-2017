            Turtle graphics can be combined with the music blocks. By placing graphics blocks, e.g., Forward and Right, inside of Note value blocks, the graphics stay in sync with the music. In this example, the turtle moves forward each time a quarter note is played. It turns right during the eighth note. The pitch is raised by one half step, the pen size decreases, and the pen color increases at each step in the inner repeat loop.

        In this example, because the computation and graphics are more complex, a Free-time block is used to decouple the graphics from the master clock. The "Free-time* block prioritizes the sequence of actions over the specified rhythm.
